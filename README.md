# NEXTJS + Tailwind + Hardhat Starter

This boilerplate contains the code needed to build a nextjs site using tailwind with hardhat integration. For more information on hardhat https://hardhat.org/getting-started/

# Quick start guide

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`
3. in a seperate terminal run `yarn hardhat` to start a local blockchain node so you can test

This app is using `@redux/toolkit` to manage some global state if you decide to build on it

# Future Improvments

I plan to create seperate branches that will use different platforms. On my list are:

1. Moralis.io
2. Tatum.io
3. quicknode.com
